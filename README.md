# Kilko Waste Management Balance Indicator

This integration exposes a numeric sensor to tell you the balance left on your trash card. Some cities in The Netherlands use this provider for paid trash containers. It's based on an API client that I've made for this integration that you can find [here](https://github.com/alinalihassan/Kilko-Container-Management-API).

Please note that I've tailored the use case for me, but it can be easily adjusted to support multiple setups and different cities. If you need that, feel free to open an issue.
